BeMyEyes üëÄ
Empowering the visually impaired with cutting-edge AI technology.
BeMyEyes is a revolutionary backend application that harnesses the power of artificial intelligence to assist individuals with visual impairments. By combining state-of-the-art machine learning models and seamless integration with the Gemini AI assistant, BeMyEyes provides a comprehensive solution for image recognition, text extraction, and audio transcription.
Features üöÄ

Image Recognition: Leverage the capabilities of the ImageNet and Tesseract models to unlock detailed descriptions of visual content, enabling users to comprehend their surroundings with ease.
Optical Character Recognition (OCR): Transform printed materials into accessible digital text with advanced OCR techniques, breaking down barriers to information.
Audio Transcription: Seamlessly convert audio files into readable text using Google's Speech-to-Text (STT) API, ensuring no spoken content goes unheard.
Gemini Integration: Harness the power of Gemini, a cutting-edge AI assistant, to provide natural language responses tailored to the user's needs, making the experience truly intuitive and user-friendly.

API Endpoints üåê
The BeMyEyes backend exposes the following API endpoints, empowering developers to integrate its capabilities into their applications:

v1/api/imagenet/: Unlock detailed image descriptions by leveraging the ImageNet and Tesseract models.
v1/api/ocr/: Extract text from images with ease, making printed materials accessible to all.
v1/api/gemini/vision: Harness the power of Gemini for visual analysis and response generation.
v1/api/gemini/audio: Transcribe audio files into text format, ensuring no spoken word goes unnoticed.
